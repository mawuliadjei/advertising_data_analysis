# advertising_data_analysis
In this report, my goal was to analyse a dataset of tv scene data and use insights, as well as statistical and machine learning rigor to build models that can help optimize advertising.

## Objective
The objective of this exercise is to build a model that can determine if a scene has a desired feature in it. Essentially, this model will be built to classify if a given scene with all it's features and characteristics provided, contains a desired feature through inference.
